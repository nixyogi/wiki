## Data Types in Rust

1. bool 
2. char 
3. Integer
    1. Signed - 8, 16,32,64,128 bit — represented as i8
    2. Unsigned - 8,16,32,64,128 bit — represented as  u8 
4. Float - f32 f64 
5. Array 
    1. Fixed - [T, N] where T is type N is number of elements
    2. Dynamic size - [T]
6. Sequence - (T, U, ..) - Where both T and U are different types 
7. fn(i32) → i32 - Function type which takes i32 as input and i32 as output.
