## Data structures 
Primarily used to organize and manage the data. The goal of a data structure is to efficiently do certain operations like search, insert, sort, etc..

## Classification 

1.  Primitive data structure: eg: int, float, double etc..
2.  Non Primitive data structure: eg: array, linked list etc..
    1.  Linear 
        1.  Static: Array 
        2.  Dynamic: Linked List, Stack, Queues 
    2.  Non-Linear 
        1.  Trees
        2.  Graphs

## Operations on DS 

1.  Traversing - Visiting each element of a DS.
2.  Insertion - Adding data elements to a data structure. 
3.  Deletion - Removing data elements from a DS.
4.  Searching - Finding a data element from DS. (linear and binary search)
5.  Sorting - Arranging the data in a particular order. (insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, quick sort etc..)
6.  Merging - When 2 data structures of same type are joined together.
