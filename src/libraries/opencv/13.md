## Detection 
Detection in OpenCV can be used to detect objects and detect features.

OpenCV actually provides various methods for Detection 
1. Cascade 
2. SVM 


I have tried Cascade with example 

## Cascade 
Cascades are basically classifiers which are very simple to train. 
Classifiers can be face, eye, sign board, text etc...

Training them is simple and does not need a large dataset.
