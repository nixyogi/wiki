Certainly! Here's a medium difficulty problem statement for a character device driver in Linux:

**Problem Statement: Implement a Character Device Driver for a Temperature Sensor**

Design and implement a Linux character device driver for a temperature sensor. The temperature sensor is connected via I2C and provides real-time temperature readings. The driver should support the following functionalities:

1. **Device Registration**: Properly register the device with the kernel, ensuring it appears in `/dev` when the module is loaded.

2. **Read Operation**: Implement a read operation that allows user-space programs to fetch the current temperature reading from the sensor. Each read should return the current temperature value in Celsius.

3. **Write Operation**: Implement a write operation that allows user-space programs to set configuration parameters for the temperature sensor, such as setting a threshold temperature for triggering an interrupt.

4. **Kernel/User Space Interaction**: Ensure proper synchronization and error handling between kernel and user space. Handle scenarios such as multiple processes accessing the device simultaneously or attempting to read/write when the device is not ready.

5. **Error Handling and Debugging**: Implement robust error handling throughout the driver, ensuring that errors are appropriately propagated to user space and logged for debugging purposes.

6. **Module Parameters**: Provide module parameters that allow configuring the I2C address of the temperature sensor dynamically when loading the module.

7. **Documentation**: Document the driver's usage and functionalities, including how to load the module, interact with the device, and handle common issues.

**Constraints:**
- Use kernel coding standards and best practices.
- Ensure compatibility with recent Linux kernel versions (e.g., 4.x or later).
- Assume the temperature sensor is already interfaced with the I2C bus and functions correctly.

**Deliverables:**
- A well-commented and documented kernel module source code.
- Makefile for building the module.
- README file explaining how to build, load, and use the module.

**Additional Considerations (Bonus Tasks):**
- Implement interrupt handling for the temperature sensor to notify the kernel when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.
- Add support for asynchronous I/O operations (optional).

This problem statement covers a range of tasks from basic device registration and read/write operations to more advanced topics like interrupt handling and asynchronous I/O, making it a medium difficulty exercise suitable for learning Linux device driver development.
