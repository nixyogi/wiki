Certainly! Here's another problem statement for a character device driver in Linux:

**Problem Statement: Implement a Character Device Driver for a Simple GPIO-based Device**

Design and implement a Linux character device driver for a simple GPIO-based device, such as an LED or a push-button switch. The driver should support the following functionalities:

1. **Device Registration**: Register the device with the kernel, ensuring it appears in `/dev` when the module is loaded.

2. **Read Operation**: Implement a read operation that allows user-space programs to fetch the current state of the GPIO pin. For example, if the device is an LED, reading should return its current on/off state; if a push-button, reading should return its current pressed/unpressed state.

3. **Write Operation**: Implement a write operation that allows user-space programs to control the GPIO pin. For instance, writing '1' could turn an LED on, and writing '0' could turn it off. For a push-button, writing could configure the pin for pull-up or pull-down resistors.

4. **Kernel/User Space Interaction**: Ensure proper synchronization and error handling between kernel and user space. Handle scenarios such as multiple processes accessing the device simultaneously or attempting to read/write when the device is not ready.

5. **Error Handling and Debugging**: Implement robust error handling throughout the driver, ensuring that errors are appropriately propagated to user space and logged for debugging purposes.

6. **Module Parameters**: Provide module parameters that allow configuring the GPIO pin number and its initial configuration (e.g., input or output) dynamically when loading the module.

7. **Documentation**: Document the driver's usage and functionalities, including how to load the module, interact with the device, and handle common issues.

**Constraints:**
- Use kernel coding standards and best practices.
- Assume the GPIO pin is accessible and functions correctly on the hardware platform.
- Support recent Linux kernel versions (e.g., 4.x or later).

**Deliverables:**
- A well-commented and documented kernel module source code.
- Makefile for building the module.
- README file explaining how to build, load, and use the module.

**Additional Considerations (Bonus Tasks):**
- Implement interrupt handling for the GPIO pin to notify the kernel when its state changes (e.g., when a push-button is pressed).
- Add support for asynchronous I/O operations (optional).

This problem statement provides a practical exercise in writing a Linux character device driver for a GPIO-based device, allowing you to learn fundamental concepts like GPIO manipulation, synchronization, and error handling in the kernel space.
