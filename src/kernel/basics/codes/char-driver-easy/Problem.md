Certainly! Here's an easy problem statement for a character device driver in Linux:

**Problem Statement: Implement a Character Device Driver for a Simple Counter**

Design and implement a Linux character device driver for a simple counter. The driver should support the following functionalities:

1. **Device Registration**: Register the device with the kernel, ensuring it appears in `/dev` when the module is loaded.

2. **Read Operation**: Implement a read operation that allows user-space programs to fetch the current count value from the device. Initially, the count should start from zero.

3. **Write Operation**: Implement a write operation that allows user-space programs to reset the count value back to zero. For example, writing 'R' to the device could reset the count.

4. **Kernel/User Space Interaction**: Ensure proper synchronization and error handling between kernel and user space. Handle scenarios such as multiple processes accessing the device simultaneously or attempting to read/write when the device is not ready.

5. **Error Handling and Debugging**: Implement basic error handling throughout the driver, ensuring that errors are appropriately propagated to user space and logged for debugging purposes.

6. **Documentation**: Document the driver's usage and functionalities, including how to load the module, interact with the device, and handle common issues.

**Constraints:**
- Use kernel coding standards and best practices.
- Support recent Linux kernel versions (e.g., 4.x or later).

**Deliverables:**
- A well-commented and documented kernel module source code.
- Makefile for building the module.
- README file explaining how to build, load, and use the module.

**Additional Considerations (Bonus Tasks):**
- Implement support for incrementing and decrementing the counter with specific write operations ('+', '-' commands).
- Add module parameters to customize the initial count value dynamically when loading the module.

This problem statement focuses on fundamental aspects of writing a character device driver in Linux without delving into complex hardware interactions, making it suitable for beginners to gain hands-on experience with kernel module development.
