## Linux Device Model

The primary purpose of this model is to maintain internal data structures that reflect the state and structure of the system. Such information includes what devices are in the system, how they are in terms of power management, what bus they are attached to, what drivers they have, along with the structure of the buses, devices, drivers in the system.

To maintain this information, the kernel uses the following entities:

device - a physical device that is attached to a bus
driver - a software entity that can be associated with a device and performs operations with it
bus - a device to which other devices can be attached
class - a type of device that has a similar behavior; There is a class for disks, partitions, serial ports, etc.
subsystem - a view on the structure of the system; Kernel subsystems include devices (hierarchical view of all devices in the system), buses (bus view of devices according to how they are attached to buses), classes, etc.

## kobjects, ksets, and ktypes
These are core abstractions in the Linux kernel's device model, used to manage the hierarchical organization of devices and drivers.

## kobjects:

-   Fundamental building blocks in the Linux device model.
-   Represent kernel objects, such as devices, drivers, or other resources.
-   Provide a common interface for managing reference counting and object lifecycle.
-   Can be linked to a sysfs entry, exposing kernel objects to user space.

## ksets:

-   Collections of kobjects.
-   Group related kobjects together, providing a way to manage sets of kernel objects.
-   Often used to represent a collection of devices on a bus or a set of related subsystems.

## ktypes:

-   Define the type of a kobject.
-   Specify functions for managing the kobject's lifecycle, such as initialization, release, and show store methods for sysfs attributes.
-   Ensure that kobjects are handled correctly according to their specific type.

## Relationship:
-   kobjects are the individual kernel objects.
-   ksets are groups of kobjects.
-   ktypes define the behavior of kobjects within a kset.
