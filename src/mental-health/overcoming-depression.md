# Overcoming depression 

Today everyone talks about physical fitness but very few people talk about 
mental health, especially in India the awareness is very low. Moreover 
due to a social stigma about mental health it is not discussed much leading to 
lack of knowledge and understanding to come out of it. 

## What happened ? 

Mar 2020, COVID hit and there was a strict lockdown for 3-4 months which then 
continued upto 9 months. Due to my introvert nature I took the opportunity 
to stay indoors as much as possible. I was fortunate enough to live with my 
family during these times. 

I was working at a startup and during the times of covid we shifted to fully 
remote work (i.e always WFH). 

This lifestyle slowly started affecting my physical health and mental health. 
I had gained 7kgs and my interest in my work and motivation for my work was 
going down. But I was totally unaware of it at that time.

By Aug 2021, I had lost all the motivation for working and my productivity was 
low. Same month I got vaccinated and now atlast was free to go out. But 
again I did not. Maybe once or twice a month I used to go out of my home 
(2BHK apartment). 

All this abuse had an effect on physical and mental health. Physically I was 
not fit due to lack of exercise. Mentally I was constantly distracted and 
always wanted to either watch youtube or read novels. 

Fastforward to Aug 2022, the startup was in a decline & we were not generating 
any revenue. My physical health and mental health declined, further leading 
to low productivity causing the startup to decline more. One say startup Founder
Nik sir asked me to get myself tested and I got myself tested, found out that 
I had severe Vitamin D and B12 deficiency.

Now that I knew what was wrong I started healthy diet and started exercising 
going to Gym. Took B12 and D3 suppliments. 

Sept 2022, re took the test and the report was good, Vitamin B12 and D deficiency 
was gone and I was back to normal. Physically I lost 7kgs and was fitter than
before and mentally I thought that I was back. Productivity increased a bit 
but startup was still in decline. 

Jan 2023, our startup did not have any revenue generation and only 3 months 
of operating cost was left. I asked my founder to fully cut my pay so that 
the startup can survive. The Vitamin D deficiency was back, because I fell back 
to my old habits. 

Since the startup was not doing good I went into depression, At that time I did 
not know about this, but I had fully lost all my motivation for work. Productivity
hit all time low. I had lost my clarity and overall purpose in life. 
I felt that I had lost everything. 

I did think of suicide few times, but did not act on it. Moreover I was not 
able to understand where these suicidal thoughts came from. At this point I had 
hit rock bottom. 

## How did I overcome this ? 

### Improving Physical health 

1.  Started sitting in the Sun: Everyday 7:00 am to 7:30 am I started sitting 
    in the sun. 

2.  Started regular exercise: Yoga for 30 mins either 7:30 am to 8:00 am or 
    6:30 am to 7:00 am. 


### Improving Mental health 

1.  Association of good people 
    -   I started watching few podcasts, soon spiritual podcasts were my favourite. 
    -   I stumbled upon the [Gita course by HG Amogh Lila prabhu](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzT1yw_wugHB8lcho3VBnkkMwl36KwThb) this was a game changer, this re-ignited the fire within me. 

2.  Mantra meditation 
    -   Next I started with reciting a mantra, recited Rudra chamakam everyday 
        at 8:30 am, it takes 15mins to recite. 
    -   Slowly I began to see the change, within 15 days my thoughts were becoming clearer. 
    -   Soon I was introduce to Mantra meditation, so I began chanting 
        Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra along with Rudra. 

3.  Started reading Bhagwad Gita: 
    -   Learnt how to handle these situations from Gita. 
    -   Realised how insignificant were my problems. 
    -   It gave me the motivation and guidance to improve myself. 

It took some time but by May 2023, I had 
1.  Improved physical fitness. 
1.  Gratitude towards parents and my team at work. 
1.  Improved clarity and motivation. 
1.  I got back the purpose in my life. 
1.  Improved productivity. 

The situation is still the same, startup is still declining, I have not received 
any pay since Jan 23 (for almost 5 months). My savings are almost gone, 3 months 
more until my bank balance is 0 . But I am no longer depressed, rather I am 
excited to face these new set of challenges head on and ready to learn from 
the mistakes that I am going to make in the future. 

#### Mistakes I made  

1.  Did not realize that I was depressed. Even when I was confronted I dismissed
    it saying how can I be depressed. 

1.  Did not consult any doctor or therapist. 

1.  I was too rigid with my schedule i.e if I got up at 6:35 am then I would 
    just skip exercise. Rather than rigid, I should have more floating schedule.  


## Conclusion 

In this age, mental health is very important. There will always be situations 
in life where your mental health will take a hit, for example: 
1.  Toxic work culture 
2.  Mass Layoffs 
3.  Family problems 

Problems will keep coming, but it is upto you to either face them head on or 
to give into them. 

This document is reminder for all the problems that I faced and how I overcame 
them.
